### Defining the Project Name

#### Choosing the Deity

> **PatchaIT:**  
Hermes was the messenger deity, right? Are there similar deities in other
  religions?

**Chantal:**  
Yes, Hermes was the messenger of the gods in Greek mythology.
  Other similar deities include:

* Mercury (Roman mythology): Equivalent to Hermes, a messenger god.
* Thoth (Egyptian mythology): God of writing, magic, wisdom, and the moon,
    often serving as a messenger for the gods.
* Iris (Greek mythology): Goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods.
* Odin (Norse mythology): While primarily known as the chief god,
    Odin often traveled and sent messages.
* Hermod (Norse mythology): A lesser-known god who acted as a messenger,
    particularly known for his journey to Hel to request the return of Baldr.

These deities share roles related to communication, messages, and travel.

> **PatchaIT:**  
Which of the deities you mentioned would be most suitable for a program name,
  considering readability, memorability, and less common use for this purpose?

**Chantal:**  
Considering readability, memorability, and less common use, Hermod could be a
  suitable choice:

* Readability: The name "Hermod" is easy to read and pronounce.
* Memorability: It's unique and distinct, making it easy to remember.
* Less Common Use: Compared to names like Hermes or Mercury, "Hermod" is less
    commonly used in technology or program names, reducing the chance
    of confusion.

#### Choosing the Distinctive Postfix

> **PatchaIT:**  
Do you think "hermod-gippitty" as a program name has any pitfalls?

**Chantal:**  
Here are a few considerations:

* Pronunciation Variability: People might pronounce "gippitty" differently,
    similar to how "gif" is pronounced variably.
* Professionalism: If the program is intended to be professional, the whimsical
    nature of "gippitty" might not appeal to everyone.
* Underscore vs. Hyphen: Using an underscore (hermod_gippitty) instead of a
    hyphen (hermod-gippitty) could make it clearer and more consistent with
    common naming conventions in programming.

> **PatchaIT:**  
What about using an underscore? hermod_gippitty? And reconsidering the double
  letter? Maybe gipitty or gippity instead of gippitty?

**Chantal:**  
Using an underscore (hermod_gippitty) is a good idea as it aligns with common
  naming conventions and avoids issues with the hyphen. As for the spelling of
  "gippitty":

* Gippity: Simplifies the spelling and reduces redundancy, making it easier to
    remember and type.
* Gipitty: Also simplifies the spelling, though "gippity" might look slightly
    more balanced.

Given these options, hermod_gippity or hermod_gippity could work well.

#### Summary

After discussing various factors such as readability, memorability,
  and professional appearance, we decided on the name hermod_gippity
  for the project.
This name balances uniqueness with ease of use, making it a fitting choice
  for the project's goals.

### Choosing the Java Version

> **PatchaIT:**  
Which version of Java would be better for the project: Java 17 or Java 21?

**Chantal:**  
When choosing between Java 17 and Java 21, here’s a comparison:

* Java 17
  * **Long-Term Support (LTS)**: Java 17 is an LTS version, meaning it will
      receive security updates and bug fixes for several years.
    It’s a stable and safe choice for long-term projects.
  * **Wider Adoption**: Since it’s an LTS version, many companies and
      developers have already adopted it, which means more available resources
      and compatible libraries.
  * **Stability**: LTS versions are known for their stability and reliability,
      making them ideal for mission-critical applications.

* Java 21
  * **Latest Features**: Java 21 includes all the new features and improvements
      introduced after Java 17.
    If your project can benefit from these features, Java 21 might be a
      good option.
  * **Not LTS**: Java 21 is not an LTS version, meaning support will be
      shorter than Java 17.
    You’d need to upgrade to a later version sooner than with Java 17.
  * **Compatibility**: The adoption of Java 21 may not be as widespread as
      Java 17, so you might encounter fewer resources and community support.
    However, for most applications, the differences shouldn’t be an issue.

If you choose Java 21, keep in mind:

* **Shorter Support**: Since it’s not an LTS version, you’ll need to plan
    for more frequent updates.
* **Compatibility**: Make sure that all the libraries and tools you use are
    compatible with Java 21.
  Most major libraries update quickly, but it’s always a good idea to check.

> **PatchaIT:**  
I don’t have a team; it’s just me (and you).
Java 17 might be a safer bet for compatibility, but I’m not sure about
  the new features in Java 21.

**Chantal:**  
Given that you’re working alone on the project, Java 17 would probably
  be the safest and most practical choice.
It offers better compatibility with libraries, is stable, and has
  long-term support.

Java 21 might be an option in the future if you want the latest features,
  but for now, Java 17 would provide more peace of mind and stability for
  your project.

#### Conclusion

After considering the trade-offs, **Java 17** was chosen for the
  "hermod_gippity" project, mainly due to its LTS status, wider compatibility
  with libraries, and overall stability.
Java 21 remains a potential future option for when the project grows and
  new features are needed.

### IDE Selection

> **PatchaIT**:  
Hi, What are the main differences between the free and
  paid versions of IntelliJ?

**Chantal**:  
The main differences between IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (free) and
  IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (paid) are:

* **Support for languages and frameworks**: The Community Edition mainly
    supports Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and basic features for other languages.
  The Ultimate edition supports a wider range of languages (like SQL,
    JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.) and frameworks (like Spring, Java EE,
    Grails, etc.).
* **Web and enterprise development tools**: Ultimate offers advanced tools
    for web and enterprise development, including support for JavaScript,
    TypeScript, databases, SQL, enterprise development tools like Spring,
    Java EE, and more.
* **Collaboration and integration tools**: Ultimate includes tools for
    integration with advanced version control systems, code review tools,
    CI/CD integration, and more.
* **Support and updates**: Ultimate provides access to professional support
    and more frequent updates with new features.

> **PatchaIT**:  
Speaking about our hermod_gippity project, I anticipate it will be a tool
  to send messages to JMS queues.
Initially, it will have basic features, and then we’ll expand it gradually.
It will be a Maven project with Java 17.
At some point, I might also try to add some graphics.
With these assumptions, should I tackle it with Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
  Community Edition? Considering that I am already familiar with Eclipse,
  as I use it at work (hermod_gippity will be more of a hobby,
  not my main job), but I’d also like to take a look at IntelliJ because
  more and more colleagues are using it (even though they shouldn’t,
  because it’s not the reference IDE for the project I work on).

**Chantal**:  
Given your hermod_gippity project and the fact that it will mainly be a hobby,
  I think IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition could be a good choice for you.
  Here’s why:

* **Support for Maven and Java 17**: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition fully
    supports Maven and Java 17, so you shouldn’t encounter issues configuring
    and managing your project.
* **User Experience and Productivity**: IntelliJ IDEA is known for its powerful
    code completion, code navigation, and refactoring features.
  It can improve your productivity even compared to Eclipse.
* **Familiarity and Learning Curve**: Although you’re already familiar with
    Eclipse, trying IntelliJ IDEA can be useful to see how it works and what
    benefits it offers.
  Since this is a hobby project, you can take your time to learn it without
    pressure.

As for any limitations of the Community Edition, the lack of support for some
  advanced frameworks and tools (present in the Ultimate version) shouldn’t
  affect your initial project. You might encounter some limitations,
  but for a hobby project based on Maven and JMS, the Community Edition
  should be enough.

> **PatchaIT**:  
One question. At work, when we use Eclipse, we usually download the repository
  locally to one folder, then create the Eclipse workspace in another,
  and import the project into that workspace.
  This is to avoid Eclipse adding its workspace configuration files to
  the repository.
Should I do something similar with IntelliJ, or does it not have these issues?

**Chantal**:  
With IntelliJ IDEA, there’s no need to create a separate workspace like you
  do with Eclipse.
IntelliJ IDEA handles project configuration files differently and doesn’t
  "pollute" your repository with unnecessary configuration files.
However, there are some precautions you can take to keep your repository clean:

1. Add IntelliJ-specific configuration files and folders to your `.gitignore`.
    These include:

    ```plaintext
    .idea/
    *.iml
    out/
    ```

    This will prevent Git from tracking the IDE configuration files.

2. Continue using an organized directory structure.
    You can keep your project in the same folder you clone it to,
      and IntelliJ IDEA will handle its configuration files in the `.idea`
      folder without interfering with the source code.

3. For compiled files and generated packages, you can also add the `target`
      folder to your `.gitignore`:

    ```plaintext
    target/
    ```

    This will ensure that temporary and compiled files are not tracked in your
      repository.

> **PatchaIT**:  
For the `Compiled class file` and `Package Files` sections, wouldn’t it be
  enough to just ignore the target folder in git?

**Chantal**:  
Yes, exactly. Ignoring the `target` folder is enough to prevent Git from
  tracking the compiled files and generated packages from Maven.
Your `.gitignore` should include:

  ```plaintext
  target/
  ```

This way, all temporary and generated files during the build process will be
  ignored by Git and not included in your commits.

### Best Practices for Project Folder Structure

> **PatchaIT:**  
I wanna fit my documentation into project folders.
Which are the most common best practices for project folder structure?

**Chantal:**  
Organizing the folders of a project in a clear and standardized way is crucial
  to keep the code tidy and maintainable.
Although there are various conventions depending on the programming language,
  framework, or community, there are some general best practices that
  you can follow.
Here is a common structure for a project that suits various types of software
  projects:

#### General Project Structure
